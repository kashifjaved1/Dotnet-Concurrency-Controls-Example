# .NET Concurrency Controls Example

![.NET Core](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-8.0-purple)
![SignalR](https://img.shields.io/badge/SignalR-Yes-blue)
![Redis](https://img.shields.io/badge/Redis-3.1.0-red)

A practical demonstration of three locking strategies in .NET for handling concurrent bookings:

- üîí **SQL Pessimistic Locking** (UPDLOCK/ROWLOCK)
- üß† **In-Memory Semaphore Locking**
- üåê **Distributed Redis Locking**

## Features

- Real-time lock status updates via SignalR
- Optimistic concurrency with EF Core `RowVersion`
- Clean architecture with DI services
- Responsive UI with lock notifications
- Switchable lock providers via configuration
